# Requirements for MISA Project

## Software Requirements

1. **Python 3.7+**:

   * This project is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.
   * Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Required Python Libraries**:
   To run the project, the following Python libraries must be installed:

   * `speechrecognition`: A library for speech-to-text conversion.

     ```bash
     pip install SpeechRecognition
     ```

   * `pygame`: A library used for audio playback.

     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

   * `elevenlabs`: For using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API.

     ```bash
     pip install elevenlabs
     ```

   * `google-generativeai`: For generating responses using Google Gemini AI.

     ```bash
     pip install google-generativeai
     ```

   * `python-dotenv`: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.

     ```bash
     pip install python-dotenv
     ```

   * `pyaudio` (Optional for some systems): Required for microphone input functionality.

     ```bash
     pip install pyaudio
     ```

## Hardware Requirements

* **Microphone**: To capture speech input from the user. Ensure your microphone is set up and configured correctly on your system.
* **Speakers**: To play the audio output generated by Misa.

## API Keys

To use the Google Gemini AI and ElevenLabs TTS API, you will need API keys for both services.

1. **Google Gemini API**:

   * You need an API key from **Google Gemini** to interact with their text generation model.
   * You can obtain the API key by following [Google's API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai).

2. **ElevenLabs API**:

   * You will also need an API key from **ElevenLabs** for text-to-speech (TTS) services.
   * You can obtain the API key by signing up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/).

## Configuration

1. **Create `.env` File**:
   You will need to create a `.env` file to securely store your API keys. Place this file in the root directory of your project. Example `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<Your-Google-Gemini-API-Key>
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<Your-ElevenLabs-API-Key>
   ```

## Optional

* **Internet Access**: The application requires an internet connection to interact with Google Gemini and ElevenLabs' APIs.

## Operating System Compatibility

* **Windows**, **Linux**, or **MacOS**: The script should work on any of these platforms provided that the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
